Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about gathering requirements?

My following decisions would vary heavily based on the size of the company, regulatory/security compliances, and what the company wants to get out of analytics. 
However, I would start by looking at the database structure that is already in place. Something I have seen that I believe would be useful is implementing a tier system for data. 
So tier 1 would be the raw data from the systems it originates from. Then there would be a tier 2 layer where the data is cleaned and transformed slightly. Also, every field in 
this layer will have a documented definition and documented industry-specific knowledge related to it. Tier 3 would be your use case layer, where you apply business rules and 
aggregations to create use case-specific views.
 I think by doing this, you can use your tier 3 layer to cater to whatever analytic needs are necessary. This model is also scalable and adaptable, which will be very useful as the company grows. 

To gather requirements, I would hold sessions with different domains within the company. I believe it would be good to have technology and business in these calls. With each meeting, 
I would hope to understand their specific use cases for analytics. Generally speaking, I think it is better to ask broadly what they hope to achieve and then try to fit the views to enable that. 
As for managing warehouses, maintaining and scheduling pipelines, and choosing tech stacks, I am not sure that I would even know how to start. I am very new to this, and these are things I have 
not thought about much. However, I think the best option is to always lean on the people who will be using these tools and doing this work. So gathering information from the business and technology 
groups would probably be my starting point.
