**Time limit during live workshop: 10 min**

**Hint**: Figure out the grain that the comparison need to be made in. Think in steps i.e. get the price of all the items in an order without discounts and then compare it to the orders data whose `totalprice` has been computed with discounts.



%%sql
WITH Prices as(
    SELECT Sum(l.l_extendedprice) as no_discount,
    l.l_orderkey
    FROM lineitem l
    GROUP BY l.l_orderkey)
SELECT no_discount - o.o_totalprice as losses, o_orderkey
FROM prices p
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON p.l_orderkey = o.o_orderkey
ORDER BY o.o_orderkey asc
