### [Exercise] 
Write a query to calculate the daily running average of totalprice of every customer. 
Time limit during live workshop: 5 min


%%sql
SELECT
O_custkey,
O_orderdate,
ROUND(AVG(O_TOTALPRICE) OVER(PARTITION BY O_custkey ORDER BY O_orderdate ), 2)as avg_per_customer_running
FROM ORDERS 


### [Exercise] From the `orders` table get the 3 lowest spending customers per day 
**Time limit during live workshop: 5 min**


%%sql 
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
    o_orderdate,
      o_totalprice,
      o_custkey,
      RANK() 
      OVER (PARTITION BY o_orderdate ORDER BY o_totalprice ASC)  as rnk
      FROM orders) 
WHERE RNK <= 3



### [Exercise] Write a SQL query using the `orders` table that calculates the following columns:
	1. o_orderdate: From orders table
	2. o_custkey: From orders table
	3. o_totalprice: From orders table
	4. totalprice_diff: The customers current day's o_totalprice - that same customers most recent previous purchase's o_totalprice

* **Time limit during live workshop: 5 min**

%%sql
SELECT
    o_orderdate,
    o_custkey,
    o_totalprice,
    LAG(o_totalprice)
    OVER(PARTITION BY o_custkey ORDER BY O_orderDate) - o_totalprice as total_price_diff
FROM ORDERS
